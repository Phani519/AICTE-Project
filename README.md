Steganography App
A simple steganography application using Python and OpenCV to hide and retrieve secret messages in an image.

Features

Decrypt Message: Retrieve the hidden message using the correct password.
Graphical Interface: Built with Tkinter for easy use.
Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed and install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python tkinter

Run the Script:

python stego.py

Encrypt a Message:
Enter a secret message and a password.
Click "Encrypt Message" to embed it into mypic.jpg.
The encrypted image is saved as encryptedImage.png.
